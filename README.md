# Annotated YOLO Results for Automatic Diagnosis of Lung Diseases

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook, `annoted_yolo_results.ipynb`, showcasing the results of our research titled "Automatic Diagnosis of Lung Diseases Utilizing X-ray Images Enhanced with Deep Learning".

## Data Source

We utilized the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) platform to annotate our dataset. The annotated data, combined with public datasets, is available on Kaggle at [Chest X-ray Masks and Labels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilpandey360/chest-xray-masks-and-labels).
